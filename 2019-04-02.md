MDURATION function
  Macaulay duration and modified duration are chiefly used to calculate the durations of bonds. The Macaulay duration calculates the
  weighted average time before a bondholder would receive the bond's cash flows. Conversely, modified duration measures the price
  sensitivity of a bond when there is a change in the yield to maturity.

The dated date of a bond is the date on which it first begins to accrue interest. This is often the same as the issue date, but not always. If the settlement date is before the dated date, then the purchaser will pay the issuer the accrued interest for that amount of time.

The date on which interest begins to accrue on a bond or other fixed-income security. The dated date is usually the date on which coupon payments are made, or, in the case of the first dated date, the issue date. If one buys a fixed-income security between dated dates, one must compensate the seller for all interest that has accrued in addition to the purchase price.

The date on which a newly issued bond begins to accrue interest. The buyer of a bond in the primary market must pay the issuer interest accruing between the dated date and the settlement date in addition to the principal amount of bonds purchased. This additional interest is returned to the buyer when the issuer makes the first interest payment. For example, a new bond issue with a dated date of July 1 and a settlement date of July 20 would require purchasers to pay 19 days' interest in addition to the face value of the bonds. Also called issue date.
